Blend is the world’s leading provider for Brands and Publishers looking to benefit from the deeper audience engagement that immersive content offers. We have built the largest library of premium 360° Video/VR films, available to license for use in campaigns across social media, Virtual Reality headsets and WebVR, and we run a global network of expert 360° Video Creators. Blend also makes it easy for Brands and Publishers to create their own 360 ad experiences all within the browser. Our "360 Stories" are customisable WebVR environments that deliver an engaging and shareable ad format, scalable across all social networks. Our backend is written in Elixir using Phoenix.
