  Solaris Japan launched in 2008, offering Japanese goods to people around the world. As our customer base continued to grow, so too did our list of wishes for our website. We jumped from one e-commerce platform to another, hoping to find one that could suit our needs as e-business owners and those of our online shoppers.

  In 2014, we found our solution. Shopify offered a number of well thought-out features, but most importantly, it offered us an option we had desperately wanted: customization. From then, we began transforming our digital storefront to be exactly what we needed it to be.

  We built a number of custom applications for ourselves. We needed to streamline order fulfillment, so we automated it. We needed to decrease the amount of emails we got about shipping costs, so we automated that too. We had a checklist of things we needed to do, and each check came one after another.

  After a few years, we began to realize how much money and time we were saving with our apps. And we decided we wanted to share what we had built. In 2017, we launched Lunaris: a company dedicated to making Shopify work for business owners everywhere. Weâ€™ve done everything from program integration to custom payment gateways. We even helped some stores build their stores from the ground up.
