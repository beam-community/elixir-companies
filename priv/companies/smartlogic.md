SmartLogic is a Baltimore-based consulting company that has been building custom web and mobile software applications since 2005. We work with funded startups, established organizations, and non-profit agencies to bring new projects to life using progressive, best-of-breed technologies and methods. We use Rails, Elixir/Phoenix, React Native, and whatever else we need to get the job done.
