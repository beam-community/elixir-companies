  description: """
  SumUp is the leading mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) company in Europe, with major offices in Berlin, Sofia, and SÃ£o Paulo. We started out 6 years ago and built our payment service from scratch. We created a unique device that allows merchants to accept card payments anywhere. Today, hundreds of thousands of businesses in 31 countries around the world rely on SumUp to get paid. In addition to our original hardware, mobile and web apps we have gone on to develop a suite of APIs and SDKs to integrate SumUp payment into other apps and services.
