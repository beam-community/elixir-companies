  Macrostax is the world's leading platform for counting macros. We create custom macro plans, matched with personalized recipes and meal suggestions, to help our clients achieve their goals. Not sure what “macros" are, no problem! Macros are shorthand for macronutrients; instead of counting calories, we make sure our customers eat the right proportion of carbohydrates, protein, and fat throughout the day.

  Since our founding, we have helped more than 50,000 individuals eat the "right way" for their body type and their personal goals. Our software platform, our library of proprietary macro-friendly recipes, and our team of nutrition coaches have helped our clients repair their relationships with food and transform their bodies.
