YipYip is a native mobile app developer (iOS & Android) for a diverse range of customers. We mainly work for agencies, small businesses, government & startups. We use Elixir/Phoenix to develop backends and API's for our apps but also for other web based applications such as customer portals. We have a lot of experience in hosting Elixir apps in large docker clusters hosted on AWS.
