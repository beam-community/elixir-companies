  At Welcome to the Jungle, our mission is to help both candidates and companies find their path through the often tangled jungle of recruitment. Building quality relationships is a big part of what we do: we support candidates looking for the best company to match their skills and needs and we ensure that companies meet the talents who are out there looking for them!

  Since 2015, we’ve been rapidly expanding to reach one goal: inspire every individual to thrive in their professional lives.

  To fulfill our ambitious mission, we have created:

  A content-rich website with over 1800+ detailed company profiles – including photos, videos and statistics – for candidates to use in their job search.

  A SaaS tool, Welcome Kit, our in-house Applicant Tracking System created to help HR professionals provide their candidates with the best recruitment experience possible.

  Media support with a multi-channel strategy, from digital articles to videos, print magazines and podcasts; we cover a wide range of work-related topics to inspire and guide both candidates and companies.

  Monthly events and conferences on key issues in the world of recruitment and employer branding, uniting a community of candidates and recruiters and ensuring them access to a large professional network.
