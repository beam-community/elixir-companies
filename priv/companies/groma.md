We develop a solution for employee scheduling and payroll automation in complex shift work environments ([shiftplan.io](https://www.shiftplan.io)). We deployed first Elixir based back-end services to production in 2015. Impressed by the performance and maintainability, Elixir is now powering a majority of our back-end services. Located in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
