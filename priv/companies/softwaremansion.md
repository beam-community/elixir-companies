We are a team of engineers from Kraków, Poland working for tech start-ups around the world. In most of our projects, we use React, React Native, Elixir, Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Rails, and but we do not like to limit ourselves.
We actively contribute to open source. We build - among others - Expo, React Native, and Membrane Framework - a multimedia processing framework for Elixir.
