  We're applying AI and Data Science to the field of Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure management.

  In other words, we're making the most advanced system in the world to control the way electric cars charge.

  We're a small team, and we're looking for another Elixir developer.

  You'll probably be interested in what we're doing if you are interested in:
  * Building a greener future
  * Good, reliable software design, with Elixir at the core
  * Integrating and co-ordinating external services and APIs
  * Building solid APIs for use by third parties
  * Getting involved at multiple levels in the software stack
  * Helping a promising startup to accelerate and grow

  It would help if, in addition to Elixir, you also knew about:
  * ElasticSearch
  * Kubernetes
  * Python
  * Julia
