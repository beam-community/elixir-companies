  description: """
  Inflowmatix is committed to helping water network operators control pressures and optimise their services including resilience, asset management, leakage and water quality in order to keep their customers supplied.

  By mapping where the customerâ€™s network is most at risk and exposing dynamic pressure variability, Inflowmatix can provide a narrative on network behaviour including events such as pressure surge, unusual usage patterns, negative pressures and asset misbehaviours.

  Inflowmatix can also use its unique technology to distill an accurate but simplified representation of the network. This can then be used to inform and implement pressure control strategies across the network.
