  FindHotel dares take the path no other consumer travel company dared since the founding days of Booking.com & Skyscanner: Build a global travel disrupter without huge financing.

  Having grown our bookings for +100% in each of the past 2 years, we are now helping over 1M travellers a year book great accommodation deals, anywhere in the world.

  As the hotel world turns a page on price parity and moves into a customer value centric era, FindHotel is leading the wave of change. With a team of just 55 FTEs, we are in the very beginning of our journey to disrupt the hotel bookings space. 

  Built with passion in Amsterdam & Remotely (from PL, RU, ES, BR, PT)

  Amsterdam is the home of the most successful travel company to ever exist, and we are proud to call it our home, benefiting from the unique multicultural draw of the city, the forward thinking political environment which enables migration of highly skilled workforce in every age, and the appeal one of the most liveable cities in the world has for singles and families alike. 

  As we aim to take FindHotel to far greater scale, we are hiring on all fronts and are especially focused on adding accomplished product, marketing and people leaders. While we achieved a lot, we know we have much more to learn and grow. If you have the drive to build a world class travel company in Amsterdam, reach out and join us for the ride. It won't be smooth, but oh, the places we will go!
