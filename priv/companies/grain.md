Grain is on a mission to organize all team conversations to be accessible and useful for everyone, even if you weren't in the meeting. We do this by creating a replacement to Google docs that syncs perfectly with modern calendaring and video conferencing tools so that everyone is on the same page, with a perfect record of what is important but without requiring massive behavior change.
