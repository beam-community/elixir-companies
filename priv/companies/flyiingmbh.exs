  At flyiin, we are building something terribly unsexy, however, essential for airlines and online travel agencies to improve the way they market flights and associated services to leisure travelers.

  (Re)launched in 2019 in Berlin, flyiin is working closely with one of the world’s largest online travel groups to provide them, during the next three years, with direct integrations to a wide number of airlines in North America, Europe, Middle-East and Asia-Pacific via an API platform we have built and are expanding on behalf of this customer.
