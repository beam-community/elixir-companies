TSC uses AI and the most advanced stakeholder technology to solve hard problems for some of the biggest companies, governments, and non-profits around the globe. We use Elixir and Phoenix to provide an API to our front-end applications, and for most business logic. We have chosen this stack to ensure scalability and resilience.
