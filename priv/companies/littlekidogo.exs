  description: """
  Little Kidogo is a distributed collective of world-class professionals on an ambitious mission to enhance lives through enabling African artisans to live off their work. We spend our time building bleeding-edge products that we believe will enrich our lives and the lives of the communities we live in. We are working to enable more Africans to become producers of digital content rather than consumers. We believe we can achieve this goal by actively sharing our learnings and the methods we utilize day by day to build great products. Through this sharing, we hope to enable others especially those without access to the resources needed to acquire this kind of education and ultimately give them a chance to become producers on a global scale.
