  description: """
  CFCL provides a range of software consulting services, including design, development, and documentation. So, for example, we can document and critique your system architecture, add `@doc` and `@spec` attributes, and refactor your code.

  Although we are familiar with a number of programming languages, we prefer to work in Ruby and related languages (e.g., Chef, Crystal, Elixir).
