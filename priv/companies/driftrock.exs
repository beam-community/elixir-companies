  Driftock is a marketing technology business founded in 2014 on a mission to make marketing better.

  There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought, or a bad experience when enquiring with a brand. We believe marketing can, and should be as compelling as content from your friends.

  All this is only possible through smart use of data. At Driftrock we help manage and enable data to both protect privacy, and deliver relevant, useful content that people actually want to see.

  We’re a team of passionate, friendly, driven people who work hard, but also believe that you can do that whilst still enjoying life! We have a balanced, flexible culture where we have fun and achieve big things for the company and our awesome clients.
