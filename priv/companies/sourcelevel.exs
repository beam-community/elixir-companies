  SourceLevel is a software engineering analytics and code quality solution. We integrate with GitHub and analyze your pull requests using linters (supporting more than 30 engines), automating code review, and identifying issues. We also provide software engineering metrics to understand the teams' progress and spot bottlenecks.

  We use Elixir to wrap Credo linter (we call this an engine) and running code quality reviews.
