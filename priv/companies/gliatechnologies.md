Glia is reinventing how businesses support their customers in a digital world.

You know when you’re on a company’s website or mobile app and you’re having trouble getting something done? Typically you have to call the company and start from scratch. Glia is Digital Customer Service and enables a rep from that company to engage with you right where you are online, see your screen, and co-pilot you to resolve your issue- without you having to re-explain yourself as you go. You can text chat with the rep, talk to them on your phone or through your computer, and even video chat while they guide you.

We work mainly with banks and insurance companies, from your local credit union to many Fortune 100 companies.
