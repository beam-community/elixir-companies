We are Impraise, a team of international hackers, business hustlers and creative brains backed by the world's most renowned startup accelerator, Y Combinator. We are here to make the process of management easier, especially for engineering managers new to it. We have a passion for design of beautiful products and we like to work with people who can bring in new skills, experience and energy. We are probably one of the most international startup teams of our size. We value open communication across different cultures and learning from each other, both personally and professionally. We made it our mission to change the way people learn and develop themselves at work by making feedback employee-driven.
