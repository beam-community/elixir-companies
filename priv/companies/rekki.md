REKKI is a free mobile app that allows you to order and chat with any supplier.

We are a highly technical and inquisitive bunch still small enough that anyone can impact and influence.
We like to take risks on technologies that will pay off in the long term, like Elixir, RabbitMQ, or React Native.

Elixir powers our core systems such as chat and orders, and much more.

We're always looking for talented people no matter the role so feel free to reach out to us.
