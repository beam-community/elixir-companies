  description: """
  Founded in January 2019, Shoreline Software develops tools to empower software service operators. Our founding team has experience building and operating mission critical databases, cloud services with millions of hosts, and self tuning feedback control systems. At Shoreline, we believe operators shouldn't wake up when servers go down, systems should be fault tolerant & self healing, and stability comes from automatic adjustments rather than operator alarms. We are well funded and based in Redwood City, CA.
