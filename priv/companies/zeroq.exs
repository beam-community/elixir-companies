  ZeroQ is a platform that takes advantage of new mobile and big data technologies to take customer service to another level.

  For the user, it allows, among other things, to take and monitor the service appointment from the cell phone avoiding wasting time waiting, arriving just in time to be attended.

  ZeroQ also uses the latest developments in machine learning to project future customer flows so that companies always have the optimal number of staff at the times they really need them. Thus solving the problem of poor service and poor distribution of resources in branches.

  With ZeroQ we have added technology to the queues, enabling efficient and cost-effective face-to-face user interaction, bridging the gap between the physical and virtual world.
