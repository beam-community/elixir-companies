  At Wunder, our mission is to solve traffic in the world’s most gridlocked cities through carpooling. It’s an epic mission that requires a combination of technology and community. Striving for excellence in these two areas is what makes us different. We use Elixir/Phoenix/OTP for most parts of the system.
