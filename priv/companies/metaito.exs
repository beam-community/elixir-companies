  Metaito is developing Factsplat, a tool that changes the way people navigate the internet. It is an innovative service that allows individuals to organize their digital resources in clear and flexible structures to enhance their browsing experience. For businesses, it is a management, collaboration and productivity tool that provides teams and individuals with a shared overview of resources, tools and workflows, helping them to efficiently execute their work processes.

  Our goal is to give people the capacity to filter, select, organize and share information flows that are relevant to them and their peers. We want to improve the world by making people more deliberate and aware of their use of tools and services on the internet.
