  We're based in the heart of Gothenburg, Sweden, and our free football academy is in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

  Our motto is that if the team is feeling well, the company is feeling well. That's why we created what we believe is one of the best ways of working where every employee has the autonomy to create a good balance between work and free time. As with everything, we strive to make the work environment and our products even better.

  We are dedicated to building high-quality mobile products for football fans all over the world. We are in this game for the long term and we will exist for the next 100 years. With your help, we will be able to reach our next goal of 300 million users and deliver scores to every fan and for every single match in the world. Together we can make the world of football a better place and available for everyone.

  Forza Football is bootstrapped and profitable, which means no interference from investors. We have full control over our company and products, and we build things we are proud of. We keep everything simple, and avoid lengthy company policies and bureaucracy. We value self-reliance, and believe the success of the company relies on the actions of each individual.
