Flatiron School teaches passionate, creative people how to code in our immersive in-person bootcamps and through our online training platform Learn.co.  We recently joined the WeWork family as we continue our mutual mission to enable passionate people to learn the skills they need to pursue careers and lives they love.  We utilize Elixir to power our in-browser IDE functionality.
