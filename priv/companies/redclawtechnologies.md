RedClaw Technologies is a software cooperative focused on helping companies solve their problems around real-time and high concurrency web systems and IoT infrastructures. We use Erlang/OTP and Elixir as the choice technology for most of our development,  as well as Golang and Python for instrumentation and DevOps tools. We are also contributors to the VerneMQ message broker and offer plugin development and support for that platform.
