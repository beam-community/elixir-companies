## Development

1. Install current elixir, erlang and nodejs versions

   1. This project uses [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage the language versions of the project.
   1. Follow the instructions on [asdf#getting-started](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) to install asdf.
   1. Once complete, run the following command to install the language versions:

      ```sh
      asdf install
      ```

   **-- OR --**

   1. If you manage your language versions differently, please reference [~/.tool-versions](.tool-versions) for the specific versions to run the project.

1. Install elixir and nodejs dependencies with `mix setup`
1. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Localization

In order to add a new language to the available list of locales, you have to do the following:

- `mix gettext.extract` in order to extract all the latest gettext msgids from the code
- `mix gettext.merge --priv/gettext` in order to merge the latest msgids with the locales.
- `mix gettext.merge --priv/gettext --locale locale_code` in order the generate the files for the new locale.
- Edit the `default.po` and `errors.po` in the `priv/gettext/{locale_code}/LC_MESSAGES/` dir. You leave the msgids intact and only touch the msgstr fields, where you translate the text accordingly.
